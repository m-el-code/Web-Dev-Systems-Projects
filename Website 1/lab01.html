                    <p>Hello! And welcome to my page :p. <br> <br>
                            If you couldn't already tell, my name is Manar Elbeshbishy. <br> <br>
                            I am currently a third-year computer science student, studying at Toronto Metropolitan University (or TMU).<br> 
                            I am 20 years old, turning 21 this year (exciting!!), and enjoy both my studies as well as creative and active extra-curriculars <br>
                            While I am passionate about programming, I do enjoy gaming, staying active, baking, making art (with various mediums) and socializing! <br> <br>
                            Alongside all of my passions, I tend to 
                            hyperfixate on music, either specific artists, or albums. My current hyperfixation has been: <em>Epic: The Musical by Jeorge Rivera-Herrans</em>. <br>
                            It's available on spotify and youtube and I definetly (!!) recommend checking it out :). <br> <br>
                            
                            and one of my all-time favourite quotes down below:</p>
